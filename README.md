Hey, I'm Milo. I'm an applications and systems developer, with professional
experience in C, C++, and Python. At my current job, I maintain interfaces to
scientific simulation software, bindings, unit tests, and continuous integration
solutions. Outside of the professional sphere, I'm proficient in Rust, and am
familiar with Kotlin, Java, Lua, R, and HTML. I've worked with Linux, macOS,
and various BSDs.

This is my GitHub account, where I work, keep mirrors of projects I work on, and contribute to various open source projects.

# Personal Projects

I've moved over to [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~milobanks), and don't use this account much anymore. Mirrors are maintainted for projects I care more about. This is not a full list of all my personal projects, only the ones I would like to showcase here.

- [**Koi**](https://git.sr.ht/~milobanks/koi) ([GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/milobanks/koi)) -
  A compiler and full toolchain, written in C, featuring a custom, experimental backend architecture.

- [**Ook**](https://git.sr.ht/~milobanks/ook) ([GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/milobanks/ook)) -
  An investigative object-oriented kernel, written in C++.

- [**Kojiki**](https://git.sr.ht/~milobanks/kojiki) ([GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/milobanks/kojiki)) -
  A tool for converting GNU Makefiles to Ninja build files for faster iterative builds, written in C.

- [**Sprite**](https://git.sr.ht/~milobanks/sprite) ([GitHub Mirror](https://github.com/milobanks/sprite)) -
  A revival and modernization of the Sprite operating system originally developed at UC Berkeley.

## Less Notable Projects
